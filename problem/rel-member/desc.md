rel-member -- Relation members
------------------------------

Write a program that is able to read and store relations
and to perform membership/relationship queries.

![Relation members](/rel-member.svg)

In this exercise, by convention,
we deal with relations over
the finite set of natural numbers from 0 to n-1.


### Input and output  #io

Input will consist of several commands.
Each command may be a relationship _matrix_ declaration,
a relationship _list_ declaration
or a *member* / relationship query.

Each _matrix_ declaration begins with a line
containing the word `matrix` and number _n_
indicating the size of the domain and co-domain.
This is followed by _n_ lines with a matrix representation.

Each _list_ declaration begins with a line
containing the word `list` and number _n_.
This is followed by zero or more lines
with the ordered pairs of the relation
followed by a line containing a dash `-`.

Each _member_ query consist of the word `member` followed by
two numbers _x_ and _y_.

For each _member_ query,
your program should print whether _x_ is related to _y_
in the latest given relation
(either by _matrix_ or _list_ declarations).

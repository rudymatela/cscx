Did you know that one plus one equals two?
In symbolic terms, one can write:

	1 + 1 = 2

Using symbols we can represent mathematical expressions concisely.
For example, two thirds can be written as simply 2/3.

Here are all the decimal digits:

	0123456789

Here are all the hexadecimal digits:

	0123456789ABCDEF

or, using lowercase:

	0123456789abcdef

Here is a quote using double quotes "Bla bla bla".
Here is a quote using single quotes 'Bla bla bla'.
Here are some mathematical expressions:

	1 / 10 + 7 + 2x + y * y ** 2.
	1 < 2
	100 < 1000
	1000 > 200

One can write and as &.

100% of people are people.
50% of people are half of people.
66% of people are two thirds of people.
33% of people are one third of people.

My email is person@example.com,
that is my #1 email.

I have $100.99 dollars.

I have approximately $99.99 dollar!
I have ~ $99.9 dollars!

Can I write things using round brackets?       (Yes I can!)
Can I write things using square brackets?      [Yes I can!]
Can I write things using curly brackets?       {Yes I can!}
Can I write things using vertical "brackets"?  |Yes I can!|

Could I have just generated a random sequence of characters
instead of typing this file?

Yes, but where is the fun in that.

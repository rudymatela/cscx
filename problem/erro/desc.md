erro -- Standard error output
-----------------------------

Write a program that
prints "`This is stdout.`" to the standard output device and
prints "`This is stderr.`" to the error output device.

	$ ./erro
	This is stdout.
	This is stderr.


### Input and output  #io

No input should be read.

Standard output should contain a single line with "`This is stdout.`".
Error output should contain a single line with "`This is stderr.`".


### Scoring  #scoring

* 1/2: produces output in an incorrect format
* 2/2: produces output in the correct format


### Hints  #hints

On the shell, you can redirect stdout and stderr to a file by using `>` and `2>`:

	$ ./erro >out.txt
	This is stderr.
	$ ./erro 2>err.txt
	This is stdout.
	$ ./erro >out.txt 2>err.txt

Use this to double-check your solution.

rel-mtol -- Relation, matrix to list
------------------------------------

Write a program that converts between representations of binary relations:
from a matrix representation to a set-of-ordered-pairs representation.

![Relation, matrix to list](/rel-mtol.svg)

In this exercise, by convention,
we deal with relations over
the finite set of natural numbers from 0 to n-1.


### Input and output  #io

Input will contain several relations _R_ represented
as a matrix.
Each representation begins with a line containing a number _n_
followed _n_ lines
each containing the matrix representation
with 1 for related and 0 for not related.
The number _n_ represents the size of the domain and co-domain.

For each relation given in the input,
output should contain a representation as a set-of-ordered pairs.
The first line should be _n_, the size of the domain and co-domain.
Then there should be a line for each ordered pair in increasing order
followed by a blank line.

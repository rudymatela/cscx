bool-calc -- Boolean calculator
-------------------------------

Write a program that reads several boolean operations
and prints their result.

![A boolean calculator](/bool-calc.svg)

Input will consist of several lines each containing
a boolean operation.
This operation may be unary, in this case
the input line will contain the word `not` followed by a boolean _p_.
This operation may be binary, in this case
the input line will contain a boolean _p_, an operator _x_ and a boolean _q_.
Input tokens are separated by a single space.
Booleans _p_ and _q_ are either of the strings `true` or `false`
and the operator _x_ is either of the strings `and`, `or`, `xor` or `implies`.
Output should contain a line with the result of the given input operation.

index-string -- String indexing
-------------------------------

Write a program that prints the character at position _n_ of a given string.

### Input and Output  #io

Input contains several lines.
Each line of input consists of a string _s_ followed by a number _n_
separated by a single space.
For each line of input,
there should be a line of output containing
the character in position _n_ of the corresponding string _s_.

Each given string has at most 60 characters.

![Positions on the "Hello" string](/hello-string.svg)

Positions are indexed from 0.
If the number given on the input is 0, you should print the first character;
if the number given on the input is 1, you should print the second character;
if the number given on the input is 2, you should print the third character;
etc.

#### Example Input

	abcdef 0
	xyz 2
	Hello 1
	World 4

### Scoring  #scoring

* 1/6: works for the above example but produces output in an incorrect format
* 2/6: works for the above example and produces output in the correct format
* 4/6: works for other test cases
* 6/6: works for [edge cases](https://cscx.org/faq#edge-cases)

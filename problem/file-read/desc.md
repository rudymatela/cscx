file-read -- Reading from files
-------------------------------

Write a program that reads a name from the text file `name.txt`.
If the file does exist,
your program should print the first word found in the file.
If the file does not exist,
your program should print `name.txt: file not found`.

Here is an example command line session:

	$ ls
	file-read
	$ ./file-read
	name.txt: file not found
	$ echo Mary > name.txt
	$ ./file-read
	Mary

The name given in the test input is no longer than 60 characters
and may be followed by a line break in the `name.txt` file.

after reading from the `name.txt` file.

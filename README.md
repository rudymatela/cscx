CScx -- Computer Science by Example
===================================

This repository contains the sources to problems/exercises in
"Computer Science by Example" ([cscx.org]).
These are released with a copyleft license (CC-BY-SA).

If you just want to read and solve the exercises,
you are probably better off looking [cscx.org] directly.
Pick an exercise such as [hello], [add] or [rot13],
solve it and submit your solution there to get an automated score.

[hello]: https://cscx.org/hello
[add]:   https://cscx.org/add
[rot13]: https://cscx.org/rot13

If you instead want to host (some of) the exercises yourself
you can use what is available in this repository.
Problems/exercises are located in the `problem/` directory.
They are using the [Udge] format,
please see [Udge's README] for more details.
To use these with [Udge],
follow its setup instructions and
copy the `problem/` directory
into `/var/lib/udge/problem`.
Edit the `index.md` accordingly.
